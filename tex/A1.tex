Advice for this homework:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Words are simply strings separated by whitespace. Note that words which
  only differ in capitalization are considered separate (e.g. ``great'' and
  ``Great'' are considered different words).
  \item You might find some useful functions in {\tt util.py}.  Have a look
  around in there before you start coding.
\end{itemize}
